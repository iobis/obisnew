title: The revival of the deep sea in OBIS
---

The first International OBIS-INDEEP training workshop was attended by 33 participants from 16 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, France, Germany, Jamaica, Mauritania, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, United Kingdom and United States) and took place on 25-28 October 2016 at the UNESCO-IOC project office for IODE in Oostende (Belgium). The participants represented 20 different deep-sea programmes and data systems (see list below).

The meeting brought together deep-sea biologists and data managers and created the momentum to build an international alliance of young scientists with a common vision to provide open access to deep-sea biodiversity data and enhance our understanding of the deep-ocean ecosystem in order to better inform ocean governance and management.

The group called for:
 
  * The establishment of a data-sharing platform, built on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), with the aim to provide a single integrated access point to high-quality data and information on the diversity, abundance and distribution of all deep-sea organisms and their ecosystem properties, including habitat and environmental characteristics.  
  * The promotion of guidelines and best practices in data management and to make these principles common practice through training the next generation of deep-sea scientists.  
  * The deposition of all primary biodiversity data in open-access archives and data integrators such as OBIS as a mandatory condition for publicly funded research, which should also apply for scientific publications, as is common practice for DNA sequences in GenBank.  

In order to ensure the highest quality of data, the group recommended that each dataset be reviewed by an expert before it is put in the public domain and published through OBIS. An automatically generated dataset report providing summary statistics on data quality could assist this process.

The participants were trained in OBIS data standards and best practices in quality assurance (e.g. [WoRMS](http://www.marinespecies.org) and [LifeWatch](http://lifewatch.be/data-services/) tools) and data publishing as well as in data access and analytical and visualization tools using the R OBIS package and GIS software (see [OBIS Manual](http://iobis.org/manual/#access)). All the training material, including video presentations, are available on [Ocean Teacher](http://bit.ly/2eFr06r). 

The further development of a deep-sea OBIS node and data portal is a shared responsibility of this group and the wider deep-sea scientific community. The success will depend on the dedication of a few people, backed with extra resources such as a full-time data manager. The sharing of new data will be encouraged through a biennial review paper on the status of deep-sea data in OBIS and all new data contributors will be invited to join this effort.
