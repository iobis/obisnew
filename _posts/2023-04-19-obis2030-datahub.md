title: OBIS 2030 - The biodiversity data hub for the Ocean Decade Actions

The UN Ocean Decade recently endorsed our OBIS2030 project. The objective of OBIS2030 is to provide a biodiversity data hub made up of standardized, quality controlled and managed data to create information tailored for decision makers to help them protect and restore marine ecosystems and protect life in the ocean. OBIS2030 aims to achieve this by (i) improving the flow of historical and new data into OBIS, train the next generation of scientists and ocean professionals in biodiversity data management and contributing data to OBIS in a consistent manner, collaborate and bring together communities of practice (through clusters of decade actions) and organize or support capacity development and data mobilization activities; (ii) creating and publishing information products, at global, regional and national scale to feed directly into reporting and assessment processes; (iii) supporting and contributing quality-controlled data to initiatives in the development of a digital representation of the ocean (Digital Twin); (iv) engaging and closely working together with stakeholders in the design and uptake of information products and assist with regional stakeholder meetings; and finally (v) developing specific targets, track their progress and generate regular progress reports, and implement a consistent communication and outreach strategy.
 
To help achieve the objective, OBIS2030 plans to identify geographic and taxonomic data gaps, allowing the identification of focal zones for data collection efforts. It also plans to evaluate the gaps in taxonomic coverage of current biodiversity information, identify indicator species and ecosystems, and strategies for species distribution modeling. OBIS2030 will also collaborate with international partnerships with current and future marine biodiversity observation initiatives (such as those under MarineLife2030, MBON and GOOS), access new big data technology, and enhance its capacity to deliver processed information and standardized products to support biodiversity assessments. OBIS2030 also plans to implement communication activities associated with each delivered information product, maintain an active social media presence, newsletter, and website, and create and maintain an internal communication network with nodes and direct collaborators to promote community engagement and support.
 
Finally, OBIS2030 will support various communities that need actionable data and information products to support policy and management/decision-making at national, regional, and international scales, including industry, civil society, and the data/research community.
 
It should be noted that achieving these objectives will require significant financial resources, as they involve a range of activities such as data collection, data management, capacity building, and communication and outreach efforts. Therefore, funding and investment will be crucial to ensure the success of OBIS 2030 and its contributions to marine ecosystem management and protection.
