Richard has lived a wonderful life. He was born in the Val-d'Or city, Quebec, Canada. There he spent his childhood.

From 1972 to 1976 he was the head of a radiochemical squad aboard the scientific research vessels "Georgy Ushakov" and "Ernst Krenkel". 

After reorganization of the Institute into the Ukrainian Scientific Centre of Ecology of the Sea (UkrSCES) in 1992, Richard had become the pioneer in the GIS–technologies that were completely new for the institution. Richard was an UkrSCES Project Leader of the following international activities:
