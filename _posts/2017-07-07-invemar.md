<p>During one week (12-16 June 2017), <a href="https://www.iode.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewEventParticipants&eventID=2001" target="_blank">23 participants</a> from 13 Latin American countries (Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Panam√° and Costa Rica) gathered at the OceanTeacher Regional Training Center in Santa Marta, Colombia, hosted by INVEMAR, to get training in marine biodiversity data management and data publishing in order to spread the seeds and give the opportunity to more researchers to join the OBIS Network.</p>

<p>The main goal of the training course was to show how to organize, standardize, quality control (taxon and location checking) and publish different sorts of marine organisms databases, and train participants so they can join OBIS as data providers and/or become biodiversity data managers in their country/institutions.</p>

<p>The participants learned how to organize, standardize, quality control (on taxa and location) and publish different types of marine species data. As a result, the OBIS platform will soon hold more data about the occurrences of various organisms, such as coral species from Cuba, marine mammals from Dominican Republic, phytoplankton from Ecuador and molluscs from the intertidal zone of Argentina. All these data will be available for free through www.iobis.org, and will be a great opportunity for researchers to discover their work, and will help other researchers working on similar subjects to be in touch.</p>

<p>At the end of this course the participants are ready to join as data providers and/or data managers on their country/institutions. Upcoming training courses are planned for this year in different countries from Latin-American so stay tune and more information about future curses will be available soon!
