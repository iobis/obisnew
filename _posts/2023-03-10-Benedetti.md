We are glad to announce that Ms Lisa Benedetti has joined our OBIS Secretariat on 6 March 2023. Lisa will be supporting a new 4-year EU-funded project, MARCO-BOLO (MARine COastal BiOdiversity Long-term Observations) which aims to structure and strengthen European coastal and marine biodiversity observation capabilities. Her role will be to help establish and motivate communities of practice during the design and co-creation of fit-for-purpose data and information products.
 
Lisa is an ecologist with a B.Sc. (Hons.) and M.Sc. from universities in Canada. Her thesis research focused on MPAs as a fisheries management tool in the Caribbean. She began her professional career as a field ecologist for Environment and Climate Change Canada. Since then, she has been working on a wide range of ocean topics and contributed to international capacity development and science to policy initiatives with UN agencies and global NGOs around the world. Over the years, Lisa has worked with a wide range of ocean stakeholders and brings together a diverse skill set including project management, research and writing, intergovernmental negotiations, and capacity building training.
 
Since 2020, Lisa has been working with IOC-UNESCO in varying capacities and we are now pleased to have her join our team.
