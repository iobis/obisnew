At the [11th session of the OBIS steering group](https://www.obis.org/2023/06/01/sgobis11/), Katherine Tattersall was appointed as the new Co-Chair of the IODE Steering Group for OBIS.

Katherine Tattersall is a research data manager at the Information and Data Centre at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), home of OBIS-Australia. She has participated in OBIS Australia node activities since she joined CSIRO in 2018 and has represented OBIS-AU at SG-OBIS meetings since 2019.

Katherine is also the Data Steward for the CSIRO National Collections and Marine Infrastructure (NCMI) Business Unit, entrusted with stewardship of research data across a group of over 450 people in the National Research Collections Australia (including the Australian National Fish Collection), The Atlas of Living Australia, the marine Engineering and Technology team, the Australian Marine National Facility and the Environomics Future Science Platform. Before joining CSIRO she was the Australian Research Data Cloud (ARDC) Research Data Specialist in Tasmania and oversaw data projects, promoted and supported good data management, facilitated national use of the ARDC vocabulary and DOI services and participated in a national data service registry project. Previously she worked for the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN). Her early research interests had focused on the spatial analysis of biological marine science data, particularly animal tracking, spatial modelling and spatially explicit fisheries and ecosystems data.

I am a sincere and responsible person and an excellent listener, and would bring my experience, lateral thinking and optimistic nature to the role of co-Chair of SG-OBIS. I would love to work with the OBIS Secretariat and the rest of SG-OBIS towards our common goals including the recently endorsed OBIS2030 project and to throw my effort behind the work plan agreed by the SG-OBIS.
