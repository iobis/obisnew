excerpt: The Marine and Coastal Research Institute of Colombia (INVEMAR) is a national
  institution in charge of marine research, the generation of data and establishing
  data management systems to share environmental data. INVEMAR was already involved
  as a data provider to OBIS during the Census of Marine Life project, which ended
  in 2010. INVEMAR joined IODE as an Associate Data Unit in 2015, and now become the
  official OBIS node of Colombia. They wish to make available their technical capacity,
  infrastructure and experience in marine sciences. We are delighted to welcoming
  INVEMAR to the OBIS network!
