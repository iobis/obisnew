excerpt: 'The Permanent Commission for the South Pacific (<a href=http://www.cpps-int.org
  target=_blank>CPPS</a>) has become an <a href=http://www.iode.org/adu target=_blank>IODE
  Associate Data Unit</a> and joined OBIS as a new OBIS node. CPPS is an intergovernmental
  body created in 1952. This Regional Maritime Organization promotes and articulates
  the cooperation and coordination of the maritime policies of its Member States:
  Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. CPPS administrates two online information systems:
  the Information System on Marine Biodiversity and Protected Areas (<a href=http://www.sibimap.net
  target=_blank>SIBIMAP</a>) and the geoportal of the Southeast Pacific Data and Information
  Network to Support the Integrated Coastal Area Management Project  (<a href=http://www.atlasspincam.net
  target=_blank>SPINCAM</a>). One of the CPPS objectives is become a knowledge node
  in the region and provide a permanent platform to integrate data from different
  projects and programmes carried out in the region. We welcome CPPS to the OBIS network!'
