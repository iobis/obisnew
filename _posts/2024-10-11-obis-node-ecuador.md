title: GBIF Ecuador Joins the OBIS Network as a New Node
---

We are excited to announce that GBIF Ecuador has officially joined the OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System) network and will now serve as the national OBIS Ecuador Node.
 
Hosted at the Ministerio del Ambiente, Agua y Transición Ecológica in Quito, Ecuador, GBIF Ecuador has been a key player in biodiversity data management since its establishment in 2016. Over the years, the team has developed significant expertise in the mobilization and publication of biodiversity data, as well as in the application of open biodiversity data standards.
 
The GBIF/OBIS Ecuador node offers a range of operational services, including:
- Training in biodiversity data standards
- Data hosting and archival services through an Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)
- A helpdesk that provides assistance and support for data publication
 
As Ecuador's environmental authority, GBIF Ecuador collaborates closely with publishing partners to ensure that biodiversity data, regardless of its source, is mobilized and published in accordance with national regulations. This includes adhering to the Ministerial Agreement, which mandates that all biodiversity data submitted to the Ministry or generated by the Ministry must follow Darwin Core standards.
 
We look forward to the contributions of GBIF/OBIS Ecuador as they enhance the global network of marine biodiversity data sharing through OBIS.
