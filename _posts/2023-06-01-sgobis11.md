## Executive Summary

The 11th session of the IODE Steering Group for the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (SG-OBIS-11) was held online from 23-26 May 2023. The meeting was attended by 45 representatives from 24 OBIS nodes, the OBIS Secretariat and GBIF secretariat, spanning 22 countries.

The following key outcomes and decisions were made during the session:

Since the last meeting in May 2022, OBIS nodes published 8.8 million new records, 360 new datasets, 17 million new measurements, and reported 23,000 previously unreported species names. These contributions increased OBIS' total records to 108 million, measurements to 191 million, datasets to 4,779, and marine species to 180,000.

The IODE Committee transitioned OBIS from a project to an integral component of the IODE programme. New rules of procedures were adopted by IODE, which OBIS will incorporate into its management structure. As a programme component, OBIS will receive core UNESCO/IOC Regular Programme funding and staff support, ensuring its permanent operation and attractiveness for potential partners.

Considering the possibility that IOC will see a substantial increase in funding from UNESCO, the OBIS steering group requested IOC Member States to advocate for more stable funding and a regular programme position for the OBIS data manager during the upcoming IOC Assembly.

Five new Intersessional Working Groups (IWGs) were established to address key areas:
(i) IWG-OBIS-Data Policy will develop data and metadata sharing guidelines that can be added as annexes to the new IOC data policy if adopted by the IOC Assembly.
(ii) IWG-OBIS-Comms will develop a communication and Outreach plan to enhance OBIS' visibility and funding opportunities.
(iii) IWG-OBIS-DNA will focus on DNA-derived data sharing.
(iv) IWG-OBIS-Structure will develop a new management structure aligned with IODE rules and procedures.
(v) IWG-OBIS-Products will create a collaborative and interdisciplinary platform for the development of indicators and information products.

The UN Ocean Decade and Historical Data project teams were successfully closed, the Strategic Advisory task team was dissolved, and the role of various OBIS task teams will be considered by the IWG-OBIS-Structure.

The OBIS steering group adopted a new 5-year Capacity Development strategy (2023-2027) with a focus on regional implementation.

The endorsement of the OBIS 2030 proposal as a project of the UN Ocean Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development was welcomed. The collaboration with GOOS, MBON, and GBIF was reinforced, and a new collaboration with LifeWatch ERIC will be established.

Anton Van De Putte was thanked for serving his term and Katherine Tattersall was appointed as the new OBIS Co-Chair.

The 11th session of the IODE Steering Group for OBIS showcased the significant growth of OBIS data, its transition of a project to a programme component of IODE, the establishment of new working groups, adoption of a new CD strategy, and important collaborations. The OBIS community aims to enhance data sharing, visibility, funding opportunities, and contribute to the UN Ocean Decade goals.
