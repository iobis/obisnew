title: Beta release of new OBIS website
---

The new website provides enhanced access to data and information. Explore the new OBIS search functions on the home page and check what is in OBIS of your country or your species of interest. The [OBIS manual](/manual/) provides guidelines for data providers, as well as information for researchers on new [data access web services](/manual/#access) and the [OBIS R package](https://github.com/iobis/robis). 

Stay tuned, many new features are still in development! But hope you will already like the new website. Feedback and suggestions are welcome by [email](/contact/) or through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iobis/obis-issues/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awebsite).

The new site has been developed with support from the Flanders UNESCO trust fund for Science, through the "[Development of Information Products and Services for Ocean Assessments](http://www.iode.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=470&Itemid=100216)" project.
