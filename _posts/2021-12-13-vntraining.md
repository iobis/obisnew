We are offering a one-year consultancy contract to support OBIS in the development of training material. 

The consultancy will provide the training tools to support researchers and data managers to manage and publish data from biological observing systems following internationally agreed standards and best practices. To achieve this, the consultant will develop at least 50 short tutorials (R Markdown or Jupyter notebooks and videos of max 5 mins each), which will be available on the OBIS YouTube channel and OBIS GitHub as stand alone tutorials. Additionally, the consultant will produce a step-by-step guide to be available through the OceanTeacher e-Learning Platform, with links to the tutorials, and that can be used as part of OBIS related courses by the OceanTeacher Global Academy (OTGA) Regional and Specialized Training Centres. It is important that this standardized training material is developed in collaboration with the OBIS secretariat and the subject matter experts in the OBIS Capacity Development task team.

Full details on the call, see <a href="https://www.obis.org/documents/CALL_CONSULANT_OBIS-CD-Officer.pdf" target="_blank">vacancy notice<a/>. 

Your proposal should be submitted by e-mail no later than close of business (23:59-Paris time) on Friday 31 December 2021.
