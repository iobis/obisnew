<p>During five days (27 Nov - 1 Dec 2017), <a href="https://oceanexpert.net/event/2025#participants" target="_blank">22 participants</a> from 17 countries gathered at the IOC Project Office for IODE, which hosts the OBIS secretariat, to get training in the application of ratified Darwin Core terms, using the new OBIS-ENV-DATA standard, which combines sampling events and species occurrences with abiotic/biotic measurements and sampling facts, as well as training in using the new OBIS data access and QC tools (based on OBIS R packages and WoRMS/LifeWatch tools).</p>

<p>The main goal of the training course was to learn how to standardize, organize (OBIS-ENV-DATA format), quality control and publish marine species records in OBIS, and train them in using advanced data access, data processing and data visualization tools (e.g. the robis and obistools R packages).</p>

<p>All the training course material (in English) is publicly available via the <a href="http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/course/view.php?id=315" target="_blank">OBIS Nodes Training Course (2017)</a> on the OceanTeacher e-learning platform.</p>
