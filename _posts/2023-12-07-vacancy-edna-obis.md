OBIS is seeking an individual consultant to assist with the coordination and management of two European projects related to the development of eDNA data workflows and their integration in the European and international digital infrastructure.

eDNA analyses are gaining popularity and increasingly being used for management purposes and to provide monitoring data for decision making. However, the infrastructure and capacity for standardized data management and comparable data generation across the European landscape is still lacking. By contributing to these projects, the task of the consultant will be to review existing workflows, report on best practices and plan for a system that can be adopted across different monitoring structures, and that benefits from available existing resources.

Deadline for applications is 18 December 2023.
