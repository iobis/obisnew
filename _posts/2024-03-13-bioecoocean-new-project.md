A new Horizon EU project, BioEcoOcean, officially launched on February 1, 2024 and is spearheaded by Lina Mtwana Nordlund at Uppsala University. The project aims to create and test a globally applicable Blueprint for Integrated Ocean Science. This comprehensive blueprint will become a tool to guide ocean observing programs from the early planning stages, to data collection, to integrating results into policy and decision making. Importantly, the blueprint will include data management aspects to facilitate standardization of ocean observation data, and flow into global repositories like OBIS. As part of testing the Blueprint, the project is also conducting research on important Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) to fill in knowledge gaps, particularly for plankton, marine organic carbon, fish, macroalgae, seagrasses, and other EOVs. Co-creation as a consortium and with stakeholders in the relevant fields is highly emphasized to ensure the Blueprint will be useable for a diverse range of projects.

As a first step, the team met for an online kick-off March 5-7, establishing an important foundation and sharing how we expect to work together going forwards. The team will meet again to begin co-creation of the Blueprint and other work in Sopot, Poland in May 2024.

## OBIS contribution to BioEcoOcean

The OBIS team involved in BioEcoOcean will lead the development of the projectâ€™s Data Management Plan, to ensure data generated by the project will seamlessly flow into OBIS as well as other relevant repositories like the GOOS BioEco Portal. Additionally, OBIS will lead development of the training materials that will enable widespread adoption of the Blueprint beyond Europe, extending the project's impact worldwide.
