Recent statistics on marine biodiversity conservation published today in the IOC State of the Ocean Report 2024, reveal interesting statistics on how much do we know about what species, especially those threatened with extinction, occur in Marine Protected Areas. As of now, 93,106 marine species have been documented within these designated areas, marking a significant milestone in the effort to preserve marine life. These records, compiled from nearly 50 million distribution data points, highlight that half of these data were collected in the past eight years, indicating a growing focus on these protected regions.
 
**Key messages:**
- Over half of all, and 72 % of threatened, species have been reported in Marine Protected Areas occupying 9 % of the world's ocean  
- For the majority of threatened species, only a small fraction (median 7%) of their habitat falls within Marine Protected Areas  
 
## Marine Species Within MPAs
The data showcases that a substantial portion of higher-level taxonomic groups have been recorded within at least one MPA. This includes most species of marine turtles and seabirds, as well as over 50% of fish, sharks, rays, and mammals. However, despite these encouraging figures, a significant amount of marine life still lacks designated refuge areas, underlining the need for expanded conservation efforts.
 
## Threatened Marine Species in MPAs
Focusing on species at risk, the statistics show that out of 1,473 marine species listed on the global IUCN Red List as Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN), or Critically Endangered (CR), 1,061 (72%) have been reported within at least one MPA. The coverage for these threatened species varies across different MPA categories, with 62% in Category 3, 42% in Category 4, and 54% in Category 5. However, the median coverage of these species' distribution within MPAs is only 7%, raising concerns about the effectiveness of these protected areas in safeguarding threatened species.
 
## Conclusion and Implications
The findings are notable given that MPAs currently cover only 9% of the total ocean area. The fact that about half of all catalogued marine species are reported within these areas is significant. Moreover, 72% of species facing extinction threats find some level of refuge in MPAs, and 54% occur in the highest protection zones, known as no-take zones.
 
Nevertheless, the limited fraction of distribution ranges covered by MPAs highlights a critical area for improvement. The effectiveness of MPAs in truly protecting and supporting marine biodiversity needs continuous evaluation and expansion.
 
The higher number of species distribution records in MPAs compared to non-MPAs likely reflects increased scientific interest and research efforts in these designated areas. This surge in data collection, with 50% of data in MPAs gathered in the last eight years, underscores the dynamic nature of marine biodiversity research.
 
Despite these advancements, it is essential to recognize the limitations of current data. The statistics do not provide insights into the current presence or abundance of these species within MPAs, nor do they account for their populations outside these areas.
 
Overall, these findings suggest that existing MPAs are a commendable starting point for marine biodiversity conservation. They play a crucial role in supporting food security and the overall health of our oceans. Expanding the coverage of MPAs and establishing new ones could maximize fisheries' potential and enhance ecosystem services for human communities.
 
Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of open access to data, encouraging more comprehensive data sharing through global databases like the [Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)](https://obis.org/). This approach can improve the spatial and temporal resolution of conservation indicators, providing more detailed information to guide effective marine ecosystem management and conservation strategies.

## State of the Ocean Report
The State of the Ocean Report (StOR) has the ambition to inform policymakers about the state of the ocean and to stimulate research and policy actions towards ‘the ocean we need for the future we want’, contributing to the 2030 Agenda and in particular SDG 14, which reads ‘Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources’, as well as other global processes such as the UNFCCC, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Structured around the seven UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development Outcomes, the Report provides important information about the achievements of the UN Ocean Decade and, in the longer term, about ocean well-being. The StOR will be used to inform policy and administrative priorities and identify research focus areas that need to be strengthened or developed.
