---

With the rise in expectations related to the UN Ocean Decade and initiatives under GOOS, MBON and others, we need to make sure OBIS and its network can meet those growing needs. For this purpose OBIS will need to undertake a baseline study and perform a review of the requirements from key stakeholders (e.g., GOOS, MBON, ODIS, and those identified through Ocean Decade Actions) and do a gap analysis or assessment of OBIS nodes’ capacity to support those needs including support for EOV data management.

Under the supervision of the OBIS project Manager and in close consultation with the members of the OBIS Strategic Advisory Task Team, the Individual Specialist (contractor) shall:
- Develop a roster of stakeholders and OBIS nodes and their contact details
- Perform interviews with, and review the strategic plans of stakeholders and identify areas where OBIS can contribute
- Assess the capacity of OBIS nodes and other IODE data centres in biological data management (this could be done through a survey using IODE’s online survey account)
- Create an overview by mapping activities carried out by stakeholders with support from OBIS (including OBIS nodes and other IODE data centres)
- Identify gaps and opportunities for improvements in stakeholder engagement, including developing new partnerships.
- Maintain regular communication with the OBIS project manager, and perform weekly reporting on progress with the OBIS project manager and Task Team members

The consultant should be able to work from home with necessary computer equipment and highspeed internet connection available. We are looking for someone with expertise in interacting with stakeholders and experience in international networking. Knowledge of biodiversity networks would be a benefit.

If you are interested, please find more information in the <a href="https://www.obis.org/documents/CALL_CONSULTANT-OBIS-SATT.pdf" target="_blank">vacancy notice<a/>. The deadline for applications is 22 August 2021 (11:55 PM CEST).
