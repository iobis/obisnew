title: IODC-III, call for abstracts - Join forces with OBIS to showcase the importance
  of fit-for-purpose and actionable data for ocean biodiversity
---

Organized by the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE)—a programme of UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission—the International Ocean Data Conference (IODC) is the not-to-be-missed meeting point for the global ocean data community. The conference is an active collaboration platform that drives progress on critical marine data-related issues and facilitates connections between scientists and decision-makers. The third edition of the IODC (IODC-III) will take place on March 10–11, 2025, online and in Santa Marta, Colombia, under the theme "The Data We Need for the Ocean We Want", focusing on marine data actionability and developing capacity in ocean science through improved data-, information-, and knowledge-sharing.

Opening the IODC-III program, OBIS will host a session titled *"Ocean Biodiversity: How we can collectively contribute to the needs of the Convention on Biological Diversity's Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea's Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ)",* chaired by Katherine Tattersall and Dan Lear, the OBIS Steering Group and Data Coordination Group Co-Chairs, with support from Ward Appeltans, OBIS Programme Manager.

At a time when ocean biodiversity data is at the heart of marine conservation evidence-based decision-making processes—such as environmental impact assessments, natural capital accounting, marine conservation planning, progress tracking, and marine biorisk monitoring—this session emphasizes the need for a collective, standardized, quality-driven, and holistic approach to improving the accessibility and actionability of ocean biodiversity data. The session's organizers welcome abstracts showcasing projects and initiatives that facilitate access to accurate and fit-for-purpose marine biodiversity data at local, regional, and global levels, supporting IODE and OBIS in their mission to deliver FAIR and open data, as well as actionable products and tools.

**Abstract submission is open until 24 January 2025 (midnight CET). Submitters will be notified of the selection committee decision by 15 February 2025 at the latest.**
