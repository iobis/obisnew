**Improving coordination within the community**

OBIS is a global community of 34 Regional and Thematic Nodes representing over 1,000 institutions and over 6,000 scientists and data managers from 99 countries. Collectively, they deliver 1+ million new marine biodiversity records per month. Coordination between these contributors is essential for OBIS to efficiently treat, aggregate, organize, and make such data actionable and accessible. To that end, the OBIS Executive Committee introduced three topic-centred coordination groups: the **Product Coordination Group** (PCG) focuses on developing high-quality, trustable, science-based, actionable, robust and user-friendly data products, such as biodiversity indicators and maps; the **Data Coordination Group** (DCG) ensures the quality and FAIRness of OBIS data through quality-control processes and alignment with global standards, supporting Nodes in data publishing, and addressing technical challenges in data management; and the **Nodes Coordination Group** (NCG), in charge of strengthening collaboration and capacity across the OBIS Nodes network through training, mentoring, and regular engagement to ensure optimal contributions. The coordination groups will meet regularly and constantly dialogue with the OBIS community. The groups will set up tools and channels, such as forums and wikis, to facilitate exchanges between contributors, tackle issues collectively and improve support.   

**Strengthening the OBIS brand to enhance communication and outreach**

The 6th Executive Committee meeting participants highlighted the importance of reinforcing OBIS as a brand to support its recognition as a global leader and a driving force in marine biodiversity data. OBIS is a robust, independent, and trustworthy data source, and its scientific contributions and societal impact could be better showcased. The participants drafted four development paths: strengthening OBIS's perception through coherent and unified actions, improving the OBIS website interface to fit different users better and match current design standards, producing impactful OBIS storylines to highlight its commitment to scientific excellence and real-life impact in marine science and conservation, crafting a set of key strategic messages to enforce OBIS position as a leading global scientific infrastructure. These development paths will be coordinated, expanded, and integrated into a broader, longer-term brand and communication strategy.

**A strategic vision for the future**

OBIS is preparing for significant events in 2025, including the 3rd International Ocean Data Conference (IODC-3) on 10-11 March, the 28th IODE Committee meeting on 12-14 March, the One Ocean Science Congress on 4-6 June, and the Living Data 2025 conferenceâ€”a collaborative effort with other global biodiversity networks such as GEO BON, TDWG, and GBIF, 21-24 October. These events are crucial opportunities for facilitating strategic partnerships and advancing global biodiversity observation initiatives. They are also a unique occasion for OBIS to increase its visibility, reinforce its legitimacy, and advocate for the critical importance of marine biodiversity data.  
As the demand for high-quality, trustable, and independent marine biodiversity data continues to rise, OBIS is uniquely positioned to provide data and services to a growing range of users and foster synergies with other IODE activities. The OBIS Executive Committee developed a comprehensive work plan to sustain OBIS's progress, addressing both short-term and long-term strategic goals, such as enhancing the interoperability of its data and strengthening its role within global biodiversity frameworks. The committee also stressed the need for OBIS to balance visionary ambitions with practical resource planning to meet its users' ever-growing needs. At a time when global marine biodiversity data is becoming a sought-after asset, OBIS must adopt an inclusive, community-based, future-facing posture to remain a keystone in intersecting marine biodiversity data and tools with international marine conservation efforts.
