---

14 participants from 9 countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela) attended the OBIS training course, 26-30 September 2016. 

The instructors Ana Carolina Peralta (Simon Bolivar University, Venezuela) and Julian Pizarro and Venus Lorena Rocha (both from INVEMAR, Colombia) attended previous OBIS courses at the OBIS secretariat in Oostende (Belgium) and now organised this course in Spanish at [the Marine and Coastal Research Institute (INVEMAR)](http://www.invemar.org.co/), in Santa Marta, Colombia. INVEMAR is one of regional training centres of the [IOC/IODEâ€™s OceanTeacher Global Academy](http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/). 

This is an excellent example of scaling up capacity development in the regions through training the trainers. 

The course material (Spanish) is available online at: [http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/course/view.php?id=249](http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/course/view.php?id=249).
