<p>The <a href="http://www.kmfri.co.ke//" target="_blank">Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI)</a>, which is also the National Oceanographic Data Centre for Kenya, joined the OBIS network as the national OBIS node for Kenya. KMFRI’s main role is to undertake research in marine and freshwater fisheries, aquaculture, environmental and ecological studies, in order to provide scientific data and information for sustainable exploitation, management and conservation of Kenya’s fisheries resources.</p>

<div class="post-quote">
By joining OBIS, KMFRI will make Kenya’s oceanographic and marine biological data freely available to policy makers, environmental managers, researchers and the public at large. This will increase our knowledge to better manage and protect our oceans, and enhance our knowledge on the effects of climate change on the marine environment and marine biodiversity.

<p>Besides running the national OBIS node, KMFRI also hosts one of the regional training centres as part of IOC's OceanTeacher Global Academy and organized an <a href="http://iobis.org/2018/02/20/kenya/">African OBIS training course</a> earlier this year.</p>
