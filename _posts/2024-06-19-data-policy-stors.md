We are pleased to announce that the new OBIS Data Policy for data sharing and use in OBIS, which was adopted by the SG-OBIS-12, is available in the [OBIS Manual here](https://manual.obis.org/policy.html){:target="_blank"}. This data policy aligns with the new UNESCO [IOC Data Policy and Terms of Use](https://iode.org/resources/ioc-data-policy-and-terms-of-use-2023/){:target="_blank"}.

The policy emphasizes the importance of adhering to the FAIR and CARE principles, data quality, accessibility, and transparency. It outlines specific requirements for data submission, including metadata standards, quality control procedures, and protocols for data updates and corrections. It addresses issues including data ownership, citation, and intellectual property rights, aiming to establish clear guidelines for acknowledging data sources and ensuring proper attribution.

In addition to the revised data policy, the newly defined OBIS Terms of Reference for various roles within our community are also available in the [OBIS Manual](https://manual.obis.org/nodes.html){:target="_blank"}. These include Terms of Reference for:

- OBIS Nodes  
- OBIS Steering Group  
- OBIS Co-Chairs  
- OBIS Secretariat  
- OBIS Node, Data, and Product Coordination Groups  
- OBIS Executive Committee   

For detailed information, please refer to the OBIS Manual.

We encourage all members to familiarize themselves with these important updates to ensure alignment with the new terms of reference.
