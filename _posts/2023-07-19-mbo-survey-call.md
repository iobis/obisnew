Are you involved in producing, managing or using marine, coastal, freshwater or terrestrial biodiversity data? If yes, the new EU-funded [MARCO-BOLO (MARine Coastal BiOdiversity Long-term Observations)](https://marcobolo-project.eu/) project invites you to complete this survey to share your experiences so we can assess the data and monitoring needs of diverse stakeholders. 

MARCO-BOLO is a project that aims to structure, strengthen, and connect European coastal and marine biodiversity observation capabilities and link these to global efforts such as OBIS. The project will help us better understand and improve how biodiversity is monitored and protected in marine and coastal environments across Europe and beyond. But we cannot do this without your input!

By completing this survey, you will help inform the creation of a dynamic Community of Practice that connects generators and users of biodiversity data at local, national, regional, and international levels. As a partner of the MARCO-BOLO project consortium, the OBIS Secretariat is co-leading the creation and coordination of this collaborative platform to enable stakeholders to co-design and co-create data products, services, and tools, ensuring that project outcomes are driven by stakeholder needs and concerns. For example, new monitoring tools using eDNA, optical and acoustic techniques, to data integration methods for environmental modelling and guidance on how data can be stored, shared, and applied in policy contexts. These tools will facilitate stronger integration of data into policy processes to support the EU in achieving its biodiversity targets.

Please help us ensure that MARCO-BOLO delivers products that support your day-to-day work and decision-making. Share your experiences, indicate current challenges with biodiversity data, and suggest the data products and tools needed to overcome these challenges.

Participating is quick and easy with only 25 questions and about 10-12 minutes of your time. The survey closes on 30 August 2023.

We also kindly ask that you forward this invitation to your colleagues and circulate throughout your networks. 

Many thanks!
