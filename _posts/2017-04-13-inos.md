<p>The <a href="http://inos.umt.edu.my/?lang=en" target="_blank">Institute of Oceanography and Environment</a> (INOS) of the University of Malaysia Terengganu joined the OBIS network as the OBIS node in Malaysia.</p>

<p>INOS is already an <a href="http://www.iode.org/adu" target="_blank">IODE Associate Data Unit</a> as well as a <a href="http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/tag/index.php?tag=RTC%20Malaysia" target="_blank">Regional Training Centre</a> under  UNESCO-IOCâ€™s OceanTeacher Global Academy. This institute is a premier centre of excellence in Malaysia that focuses its activities on oceanic and marine related research and post-graduate training.</p>

<p>INOS will support the OBIS activities in the Asian region and will organise an OBIS training course for Asian OBIS nodes (and candidate OBIS nodes) on 22-26 October 2017 (<a href="http://www.iode.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewEventRecord&eventID=2016" target="_blank">More information</a>).</p>
 
<p>Since 2004, INOS manages the <a href="http://inos.umt.edu.my/?page_id=114&lang=en" target="_blank">South China Sea Repository and Reference Centre</a> (RRC). The collection has now more than 18,000 specimens. Over a thousand specimens are out for internal and international loan each year for teaching and research. The RRC is also a National Scientific Collection Centre for the Marine Life Inventory Programme of the National Biodiversity Scientific Collection under the Ministry of Nature Resources and Environment (NRE) and is a data provider for the <a href="http://www.mybis.gov.my/" target="_blank">Malaysia Biodiversity Information System</a> (MyBIS).</p>
