<p>A globally coordinated and sustained ocean observing system is urgently needed to assess the state of the oceanâ€™s biological resources and ecosystems. This system is required to address national management needs, and to evaluate progress towards the 2030 targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (specifically SDG 14), the 2020 Biodiversity Aichi targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), inform the second World Ocean Assessment, and provide guidance to negotiations on areas beyond national jurisdiction. It will build on the existing sustained observing system for physical properties of the ocean.</p>

<p>The Biology and Ecosystems Panel of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS BioEco), the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) of the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEOBON), and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), share a common vision to build such a system. The process includes identifying essential ocean variables, implementing best practices and international standards, and enhancing global capacity. Delivering the resulting information through an open access, integrated and quality controlled database will support relevant science and societal needs.</p>
