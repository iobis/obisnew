The OBIS Executive Committee convened in Ostend from 7-9 November 2023 to evaluate the progress of the OBIS 2023 work plan and to formulate the work plan and budget for the upcoming years, taking into account a significantly increased base funding allocated to core IODE program components, such as OBIS.
 
During the meeting, the committee addressed various action items, including the development of a draft communication and outreach plan, and the establishment of a new OBIS data policy and guidelines aligned with and implementing the recently adopted IOC data policy.
 
Additionally, a comprehensive review of the OBIS management structure was initiated to align it with the new IODE Rules and Procedures. A proposal outlining a revised structure and updated Terms of References has been drafted. This proposal will be presented at the forthcoming OBIS steering group meeting scheduled for 25-29 March 2024 in South Korea.
