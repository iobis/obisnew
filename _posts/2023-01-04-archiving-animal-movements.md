excerpt: Tens of thousands of animals around the world are monitored using GPS trackers
  to protect wildlife and study animal behaviour. The collected data are also useful
  for biodiversity research, but are seldom available on platforms used for this purpose.
  Researchers have developed a workflow to make GPS tracking data available in biodiversity
  data portals, and applied it to publicly archive GPS tracking data for hundreds
  of birds across northwest Europe.
