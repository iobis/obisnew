<td valign="top" width="70%"><p>Elizabeth is an ecologist by training, with a background in biodiversity, macro-population genetics, and marine biology. She completed her PhD in Biology at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada. Her work focused on collecting and analyzing vertebrate biodiversity metrics (genetic, population, and species diversity) across the American continents. Outside of research, she is very active in the martial arts community, and finds balance between life in research and life on the mats.</p>
 
<p>We are excited to have her in our team.</p></td>
