<p>During five days (22-26 October 2017), <a href="https://oceanexpert.net/event/2016#participants" target="_blank">16 participants</a> from 8 Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam) gathered at the OceanTeacher Global Academy - Regional Training Center in Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia, hosted by UMT/INOS (Institute of Oceanography and Environment - Universiti Malaysia Terengganu), to get training in marine biodiversity data management, in order to further expand the OBIS network of data users and data contributors, as well as establish new OBIS nodes in the Asian region.</p>

<p>The main goal of the training course was to learn how to standardize, organize (OBIS-ENV-DATA format), quality control and publish marine species records in OBIS, and train them in using advanced data access, data processing and data visualization tools (e.g. the robis and obistools R packages).</p>

<p>All the training course material (in English) is publicly available via the <a href="http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/course/view.php?id=311" target="_blank">OBIS Asian nodes and Coral Reef Training Course</a> on the OceanTeacher e-learning platform.</p>
