---

Under the supervision of the OBIS project manager the communications consultant has to develop visuals, key messages and story lines for a very broad audience (including students, scientists, natural resource managers and policy makers). More specifically, the contractor needs to deliver a suitably designed brochure (for print) as well as presentation slides containing:

- An infographic covering the OBIS network, activities and key value propositions
- Examples of the variety of OBIS data types
- OBIS use cases, including key scientific outcomes, and initiatives it supports
- Description of the OBIS process, illustrating the various data transformations during the full data life-cycle (from data custodians, to OBIS nodes to OBIS international)

The consultant should be able to work from home with necessary computer equipment and highspeed internet connection available. We are also specifically looking for someone outside of the OBIS network to provide a fresh perspective avoiding the current situation of stagnant internal communication processes.

If you are interested, please find more information in the <a href="https://www.obis.org/documents/CALL-OBISCommunications-ConsultancyContract.pdf" target="_blank">vacancy notice<a/>. The deadline for applications is 5 July 2020 (6 PM CEST).
