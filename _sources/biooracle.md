The environmental data we use are downloaded from [BioOracle](https://www.bio-oracle.org/) using the [sdmpredictors R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdmpredictors/index.html). See the data preparation code at [https://github.com/iobis/xylookup/blob/master/dataprep/rasters.py](https://github.com/iobis/xylookup/blob/master/dataprep/rasters.py) for more details. Code for fetching the environmental conditions by location are available at [https://github.com/iobis/xylookup](https://github.com/iobis/xylookup).
