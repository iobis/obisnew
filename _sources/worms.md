OBIS uses the [World Register of Marine Species](http://marinespecies.org/) (WoRMS) as its taxonomic backbone. This means that the scientific names in datasets provided to OBIS are matched with WoRMS either by using the WoRMS webservices or by using the WoRMS LSID provided in the dataset. Scientific names which are marked as synonyms in WoRMS are linked to the currently accepted name.
