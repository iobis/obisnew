OBIS uses geospatial data (EEZ, IHO and Marine World Heritage Site shapes) from [Marine Regions](http://marineregions.org/). IHO geometries are used to create basin geometries, which are then intersected with EEZs in order to calculate basin specific country statistics. IHO and EEZ shapes are also used to create ABNJ geometries. A 20 km inland buffer is added to EEZ shapes to correct for coastline inaccuracies. The Ecologically or Biologically Significant Areas (EBSA) shapes were provided by the [Duke University Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab](https://mgel.env.duke.edu/).
