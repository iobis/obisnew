## OBIS Sustainability

To develop and sustain an OBIS that delivers, adequate resources are required both from UNESCO's regular programme, through extra-budgetary projects, by donations from the private sector and governments as well as in-kind contributions to core activities. The OBIS Secretariat builds and maintains the central database and provides training and technical assistance, guides new data standards and technical developments, and encourages international cooperation to foster the group benefits of the network. However, OBIS cannot exist without the hundreds of scientists who generate the data every day and foster open-access to data to enhance research globally as well as the many data managers at the OBIS nodes who coordinate and work through every record in making OBIS a gold standard resource. It is critically important that OBIS is well-resourced at every level of the data value chain. 

### Is OBIS at risk?  

No. OBIS is part of IODE, which has a proven track record - it exists since 1961! However, because it operates under the UN, it brings a perception of stable financial coverage whereas many of the operations and activities depend on voluntary contributions. Fortunately, UNESCO provides the salary of one position (OBIS project manager), while the OBIS data manager is currently covered by project funding. These 2 secretariat positions are essential, without those OBIS could not be operational. However, there are many things in which OBIS could improve and provide a better service. The [OBIS Science Advisory Task Team](/about/satt/) has started this deliberation process and much of it can be read in their first [meeting report](http://www.iode.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewDocumentRecord&docID=14624).
The OBIS Steering Group nicely phrased what would be lost without an OBIS international secretariat, see annex 5 of their [meeting report](http://www.iode.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewDocumentRecord&docID=12785).

### How to partner with OBIS?

Please contact the OBIS secretariat or one of the many national/regional/thematic OBIS nodes. See list at [contact](/contact). We may try to find funding together!

The IOC Assembly Resolutions [XXVII/Dec.5.3.4.1](/about/ioc-27/) and [IOC-XXVIII/Dec.7.2.1](/about/ioc-28/) urged Member States to support the OBIS Work Plan through cash contributions to the IOC Special Account for OBIS, secondments of staff members to the IODE/OBIS Project Office, in-kind support such as hosting meetings or workshops with participant funding, or through funding of OBIS Projects. 

Cash contributions can be made directly to UNESCO's IOC Special Account for IODE/OBIS. Contact the secretariat for more details.
