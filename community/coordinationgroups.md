# OBIS Coordination Groups

To ensure the effective management and use of marine biodiversity data, OBIS has established three Coordination Groups, each specifically focusing on strengthening different aspects of OBISâ€™s work. These groups facilitate collaboration, align OBIS with global data standards, and enhance the impact of OBIS products and services.

## OBIS Nodes Coordination Group (NCG)
The Nodes Coordination Group (NCG) supports the network of OBIS Nodes by enhancing engagement, addressing challenges in data submission, and facilitating training opportunities. This group strengthens collaboration among Nodes and ensures that OBIS data contributions are consistent, high-quality, and widely accessible.
The NCG is co-chaired by Maria Cornwaithe (OBIS Canada) and John Nicholls (Oceans Past Initiative), supported by Laurent Chmiel (OBIS Secretariat)

## OBIS Data Coordination Group (DCG)
The Data Coordination Group (DCG) focuses on maintaining and improving OBIS data quality, ensuring interoperability with global biodiversity initiatives, and refining data standards. It collaborates with partners, such as GOOS, GBIF, and TDWG, to develop best practices and support Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) for marine biodiversity.
The DCG is co-chaired by Ruben Perez (EurOBIS), Dan Lear (OBIS UK, temporary co-chair) and Katherine Tattersall (OBIS Australia, temporary co-chair), supported by Pieter Provoost (OBIS Secretariat)

## OBIS Products Coordination Group (PCG)
The Products Coordination Group (PCG) develops tools and services that transform OBIS data into accessible and actionalble products. This group ensures that researchers, policymakers, and conservation practitioners can effectively use OBIS data by creating a product catalogue, enhancing visualisation tools, and supporting analytical applications.
The PCG is co-chaired by Stephen Formel (OBIS USA) and Jon Pye (Ocean Tracking Network) and supported by Silas Principe (OBIS Secretariat)

These coordination groups are key to ensuring that OBIS remains a trusted, innovative, and globally relevant resource for marine biodiversity data.
