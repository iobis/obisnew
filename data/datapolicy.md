# OBIS Data policy

This data policy is an extract from the [OBIS Manual](https://manual.obis.org/). Please refer to the manual for the latest version of the OBIS data policy. 

The Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) is an international data-sharing network that provides open access to marine biodiversity data. OBIS operates under the framework of the **Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO)** and adheres to international best practices for data sharing.

This document outlines the **OBIS Data Policy**, ensuring transparency, accessibility, and responsible data use.

## Data Sharing and Access

OBIS is committed to **open access** and follows the **FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)**:

- **Findable**: Data are indexed and searchable via OBIS.
- **Accessible**: Data are openly available through OBIS platforms.
- **Interoperable**: Data are standardized to facilitate integration.
- **Reusable**: Data include rich metadata to support various applications.

Most OBIS data are available under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY 4.0) License, which allows users to share and adapt the data with proper attribution. Some datasets follow particular licences, such as CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-ND, or CC BY-SA. We recommend verifying the license agreement for each dataset before use. 

## Data Providers and Attribution

OBIS **values the contributions** of data providers. To ensure proper recognition:

- Data providers retain ownership of their datasets.
- Users must cite the original data sources and the OBIS database.
- OBIS provides DOIs for datasets to facilitate citation and impact tracking.

Data providers should ensure that:

- Data are **quality-checked** before submission.
- Metadata include appropriate **author and institutional credits**.
- Updates and corrections are provided when necessary.

## Ethical Use and Responsibilities

Users of OBIS data must adhere to the following ethical guidelines:

- **Respect Attribution**: Acknowledge the original data providers.
- **Ensure Data Integrity**: Do not misrepresent or manipulate data.
- **Promote Open Science**: Encourage data sharing within the scientific community.
- **Comply with Legal Frameworks**: Adhere to international and national regulations regarding biodiversity data.

OBIS discourages:

- Misuse of data leading to **misinterpretation**.
- Commercial exploitation without proper attribution.
- Unauthorized redistribution of data without citation.

## Data Submission and Quality Control

OBIS welcomes data submissions from researchers, institutions, and citizen science initiatives. To maintain high data quality:

1. Data must conform to the **OBIS data format** and **Darwin Core standards**.
2. Metadata must be complete and provide context for proper interpretation.
3. Data undergo a **validation and cleaning process** before publication.

OBIS Nodes assist in data formatting, submission, and quality control.

## Privacy and Sensitive Data

OBIS does not publish **sensitive data** that could endanger species or ecosystems. Sensitive records may be:

- **Generalized** to a broader geographic area.
- **Restricted** upon request by the data provider.
- **Delayed** for publication to protect ongoing research.

Data providers are responsible for flagging sensitive records before submission.

## Updates and Policy Changes

OBIS may update this policy to reflect evolving **best practices** in data sharing. Major changes will be communicated to:

- Data providers
- OBIS Nodes
- The broader scientific community

Users should review the OBIS Data Policy regularly to stay informed.
