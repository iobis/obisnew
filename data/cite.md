# How to cite OBIS?

OBIS is an open-access data platform that provides marine biodiversity data to the global community. Proper citation of OBIS and its data sources ensures appropriate attribution and helps track the impact of the shared data. Citing OBIS data is crucial to ensure visibility and recognition of the contributors who collect, manage and share their marine biodiversity data openly. It allows for better data tracking, reinforces data transparency and reproducibility, strengthens trust in OBIS data, and supports the sustainability of Open Science. 

⚠️ Some datasets available from OBIS may have slightly different licenses, with specific acknowledgement requirements. 

## Citing the OBIS Database

When using data obtained from OBIS, cite the database as follows:
Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). [Year of Access]. OBIS Database. Available from: https://obis.org

For example, if you accessed the data in 2025:
Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). 2025. OBIS Database. Available from: https://obis.org

## Citing Individual Datasets

If you use specific datasets from OBIS, you should cite the original data providers. Each dataset in OBIS has a **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)** or a unique citation format provided in the dataset metadata.

You can find dataset citations on the OBIS **dataset page**. Example format:
[Author(s) of dataset]. [Year]. [Title of dataset]. Available from: [DOI or OBIS dataset link]

Example: Smith J., Doe A. 2023. Coral Reef Biodiversity in the Indo-Pacific. Available from: https://ipt.obis.org/resource?r=coral_reef_biodiversity

## Citing OBIS in Scientific Publications

If OBIS data are used in research, acknowledge OBIS in the **methods** or **data availability** section of your paper.

Example:"Marine species occurrence data were obtained from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS, https://obis.org, accessed [Year])."

## Citing the OBIS Data Paper

For general references to OBIS in scientific literature, cite the OBIS data paper:
Tyberghein, L., Bailly, N., Bermudes, M., Costello, M.J., Mees, J., Picheral, M., Troupin, C., and De Clerck, O. 2023. OBIS: A global open-access database on marine biodiversity. Scientific Data, 10, 52. DOI: [Insert DOI]

## Citing OBIS API Usage

If you use the OBIS API to retrieve data programmatically, acknowledge the API:
"Data were retrieved using the OBIS API (https://api.obis.org) on [Date of Access]."

## Why Citation Matters

Proper citation:

- Recognizes the contributions of data providers.
- Encourages further data sharing and collaboration.
- Helps track data usage and impact.
- Supports funding and sustainability of OBIS.
