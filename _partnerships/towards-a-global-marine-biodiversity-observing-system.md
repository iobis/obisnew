Three major initiatives (GOOS, OBIS and GEOBON MBON) signed a collaboration agreement to join efforts towards a sustained, coordinated global ocean system of marine biological and ecosystem observations to support management decisions and address relevant science and societal needs. OBIS plays a key role in fostering wider data sharing, curation and aggregation in order to streamline the feeding of integrated and quality controlled datasets into models and forecasts.
