<p>OBIS is the world’s largest open-access repository for marine biodiversity data, with over 135,000,000 presence records and close to 185,000,000 measurements and facts contained in more than 5,500 datasets, including 27,000,000 DNA and DNA-derived sequences.<br />
We are a global community of 34 Regional and Thematic Nodes representing over 1,000 institutions and over 6,000 scientists and data managers from 99 countries. We contribute to advancing marine science to improve our knowledge of the Ocean. We support evidence-based conservation efforts to safeguard the health of our Ocean and our Planet.

<h3 id="data-you-can-trust"><strong>Data you can trust</strong></h3>

<p>With more than two decades of existence, OBIS is among the world’s most respected biodiversity data initiatives. As a community, we are working together to collect and integrate marine biodiversity data to make it accessible to the widest possible audiences. Our work is based on Open Science principles, allowing for the highest possible collaborative approach and ensuring maximum quality control. The OBIS community gathers world-renowned, independent, leading marine science experts applying the latest tools, standards, innovations, and processes to data-based ocean observations.

<i>The OBIS data chain</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OBIS data offer a high degree of robustness and reliability thanks to:</p>

<p><strong>☑️ The independence of the OBIS community</strong><br />
The OBIS community is a neutral, science-driven infrastructure under the auspices of UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.</p>

<p><strong>☑️ Open Science principles</strong><br />
OBIS data rigorously follows the FAIR, CARE, and Open Data principles. Through collaboration and projects, the OBIS Community participates in developing and updating global data standards, ensuring that the Ocean is entirely part of the global biodiversity data landscape.</p>

<p><strong>☑️ Darwin Core: A Foundational Standard for OBIS</strong><br />
OBIS ensures the quality and usability of its marine biodiversity data by adhering to the Darwin Core standard that provides a stable and flexible framework for sharing biodiversity information, facilitating data integration from diverse sources, handling complex associated metadata and enriching datasets through extensions. This standard ensures that biodiversity data is interoperable, searchable, accessible and machine-readable. OBIS uses the Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) format for packaging and publishing datasets into a structured, self-contained package, simplifying data sharing and integrating comprehensive metadata. ​</p>

<p><strong>☑️ Full transparency for all data flows</strong><br />
All OBIS datasets and products are open source and can be independently verified or assessed by anyone.</p>

<p><strong>☑️ The total traceability of its datasets</strong><br />
Each dataset published on OBIS has associated metadata that clearly and systematically documents its origin, collection protocols, treatment, and processing steps, ensuring full attribution of the data, recognition for contributors,</p>

<p>☑️ <strong>A multi-step systemic quality control</strong><br />
OBIS data undergoes a strict quality control process to ensure the delivery of standardized, structurally consistent datasets using the Darwin Core metadata standard. The process includes automated checks (taxonomic validation, geospatial and temporal consistency, metadata completeness) and manual reviews for flagged records or particularly complex datasets.</p>

<p><strong>☑️ A permanent feedback loop</strong><br />
After the datasets are published on its platform, OBIS supports a feedback loop with data providers and users to fix potential detected issues, fill possible gaps, update data or improve the metadata.</p>

<h3 id="cutting-edge-observing-techniques-dna-and-edna"><strong>Cutting-edge observing techniques: DNA and eDNA</strong></h3>

<p>OBIS and its community actively promote and develop DNA-based marine biodiversity observation techniques and processes, including environmental DNA (eDNA). OBIS has also actively supported and developed molecular approaches to marine biodiversity observations from the beginning.</p>

<p>OBIS supported the adoption of MIxS (Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence) standards and integrated it into real-life projects, such as <a href="https://pacman.obis.org/">PacMAN</a>{target=”_blank”}, a biorisk-monitoring framework successfully implemented in Fiji. OBIS also pioneered linking DNA-derived data to traditional biodiversity observations using shared taxonomic and geospatial frameworks and contributed to developing and promoting robust metadata standards for eDNA datasets, ensuring transparency in sampling protocols, laboratory processing, bioinformatics pipelines and taxonomic assignments. With the <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/edna-expeditions" target="_blank">UNESCO eDNA Expeditions project</a>, OBIS demonstrated its ability to design operational and implementable resource-efficient eDNA frameworks that combine citizen science engagement and a robust sea-to-screen data pipeline that delivers high-quality, scientific-grade, reliable outputs. The OBIS Community has developed a <a href="https://obis.org/2024/10/22/obis-edna/##Publishing-eDNA-data-to-OBIS">comprehensive guide</a>{target=”_blank”} for eDNA and DNA-derived data publishing.</p>

<p>With its community, OBIS continues bridging the gap between traditional biodiversity observations and molecular techniques to provide decision-makers, researchers, citizens and the industry with the most accurate, rich and actionable marine biodiversity data.</p>

<h3 id="advanced-modeling-predictions-for-decision-support"><strong>Advanced modeling predictions for decision-support</strong></h3>

<p>OBIS and its community are committed to delivering data that can be used by a wide range of stakeholders, from experts to non-specialists. OBIS has developed a wide range of user-friendly data-based products, such as dashboards, indicators and maps, to increase marine data uptake and deliver evidence-based, actionable insights supporting decision-making.</p>

<p>OBIS has developed a unique expertise in marine models integrating multiple variables, such as species and habitat distribution, temperature ranges and climate change scenarios. These developments support the creation of advanced model-based derived data products and tools, such as the <a href="https://shiny.obis.org/distmaps/">Species Distribution Maps</a>{target=”_blank”}. This user-friendly, multi-variable tool devolped within the framework of the EU-funded <a href="https://mpa-europe.eu/">MPA Europe</a>{target=”_blank”} project, is essential to understanding the resilience of marine ecosystems and how they are evolving under the pressures of climate change, supporting decision-makers to make today’s decisions to protect the Ocean of tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="obis-capacity-building-enabling-skills-and-knowledge"><strong>OBIS capacity building: enabling skills and knowledge</strong></h3>

<p>The OBIS Community is actively involved in capacity-building activities through its thematic, national and regional Nodes network, focusing on improving local capacity to increase global contributions. OBIS and its community deliver tailored, hands-on capacity-building activities that mix technical training with open science principles on topics such as data standards (e.g., Darwin Core), cutting-edge observing techniques (e.g., eDNA), quality control, metadata management, data publishing, and the use of OBIS tools, processes, and services. These capacity-building modules are explicitly built to fit local realities and match available resources to ensure the implementation of local benefits and effective knowledge transfer.</p>

<p>OBIS nurtures an active partnership with the <a href="https://classroom.oceanteacher.org/">OceanTeacher Global Academy</a>{target=”_blank”} (OTGA) to strengthen global capacity in marine biodiversity data management and empower local stakeholders. Through its comprehensive internet-based training platform—supporting classroom, blended, and online learning—and its network of Regional Training Centres, OTGA effectively complements and amplifies OBIS capacity-building efforts. The OBIS-OTGA collaboration has also led to the development of self-paced courses, allowing learners to engage asynchronously, according to their resources and availability.</p>
